# Active Context — Current State

## 🎯 Current Focus
**Phase 3: Intelligence** — Adding the "brain" to the tools we built in Phase 2. We want the system to *recommend* the right tools and *generate* the work, rather than just validating it.

## 📋 Recent Changes
- **2026-02-14T11:59:00-03:00** — Architect (Gemini) validated Phase 2 and generated Phase 3 prompts.
- **Phase 2 Summary:** 
  - `data_validator`: Automated schema checking.
  - `scaffold`: Syntax-safe code generation.
  - `watchdog`: Behavioral nudges for task tracking.
  - `_common`: Robust shared foundation.
  - **Verdict:** PASSED validation. Solves the key "friction" complaints from Original Review.

## 🚧 Blockers
*None — 3 workstreams ready for parallel delegation*

## 💬 Notes for Workers
- **WS 3.1:** Focus on *heuristics*. Don't overengineer with heavy ML.
- **WS 3.2:** Be careful not to delete user data, only move.
- **WS 3.3:** Use `tools.plan_sync` to read the plan! Don't re-invent the parser.
