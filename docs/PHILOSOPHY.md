# 🌌 The Antigravity Philosophy

> "Code at the speed of thought."

## The Manifesto

We believe that the bottleneck in software engineering is no longer typing speed or knowledge retrieval. It is **Context Switching**.

Every time you switch context—from editor to terminal, from documentation to chat, from one agent to another—you lose cognitive momentum. **Antigravity** exists to remove these friction points.

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero-Gravity Setup
A project should be ready to code **the second it is cloned**.
- No complex installation scripts.
- No hidden API keys required to start.
- The repository *is* the environment.

### 2. Cognitive Parallelism (The Architect Model)
Humans are better at **Designing**. AI is better at **Executing**.
- **You are the Architect**: You define the "What" and the "Why".
- **Agents are the Workers**: They handle the "How".
- We embrace **Parallel Execution**: Why wait for one task to finish when you can spin up three windows and run them simultaneously?

### 3. Artifact-First Thinking
Chat is ephemeral. Files are eternal.
- Don't just talk about code. **Plan it** (`task_plan.md`).
- Don't just fix bugs. **Document them** (`findings.md`).
- Your project's intelligence should live in its files (`.context/`, `src/skills/`), not in a chat history that disappears.

### 4. Radical Simplicity
If a tool requires a 20-page manual, it is broken.
- Our tools are native files.
- Our workflows are copy-pasteable prompts.
- Our complexity is managed by the filesystem, not by obscure configurations.

## The Goal
To create a symbiotic environment where Human Creativity and AI Velocity merge into a single, unstoppable flow.
